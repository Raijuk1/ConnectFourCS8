# Work Report

## Name: <ins> Gabriel Foreman, Ryan Carrasco, Nick Montales, Matthew Moc, Matthew Gonzalez </ins>


## Instructions on adding your work into project:

1. make your own branch
    - git checkout -b [your branch name]
    - git branch to check which branch you are in

2. git add [fileName you made changes to or created]
- (reason why we don't want to do git add . because each of our systems uses different build or cmake files specfic to our system which we will have to restructure every time we pull if we added every file which git add . does)

3. git commit -m "description of your changes" 

4. git push -u [your branch name](to push your changes to your branch)

We want to make sure that our main will be updated as often as possible so to do that 

1. go to github and click on pull requests

2. click on new pull request and in the first box click on the left where you want the changes to be applied and the second box is where the changes are coming from

3. to apply the changes to your files you go do a git pull on your device to apply the changes made
